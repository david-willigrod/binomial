The package "binomial" implements functions for calculating probabilities of a Binomial random variable, and related calculations such as the probability distribution, the expected value, variance, etc.

the binomial package allows a user to create a binomial random variable object with bin_var then perform a variety of calculations with the binomial random variable object

Different summary statistics/metrics are available for the given random variable object that can be accessed by using the function summary()

The pdf and cdf of the binomial random variable object is also accessible through the respective functions bin_distribution() and bin_cumulative()

finally a plot of the pdf and cdf are accessed by the plot() function.
